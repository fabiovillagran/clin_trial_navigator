# clin_trial_navigator

This project queries the clinicaltrials.gov database based on custom search criteria, returns up to 1,000 clinical trials with detailed information on trial design 
and outcome measures, and converts the results into an easy-to-read format on which analyses can be performed.

An example use case would be identifying all pivotal Phase III trials in a specific disease state (i.e., severe asthma) in the past 10 years, and comparing trial duration, sample size, outcomes measured, and relative efficacy performance across the trials. These data could then be used in conjunction with historical sales + access data to 
inform pricing strategy for a pharmaceutical manufacturer developing a new product.
